## 📤 Exporting with Custom Rhythms

All rhythm data is **automatically preserved** when:

1. **Playing audio** - AudioPlayer uses your custom rhythms
2. **Creating songs** - Song Composer includes all rhythm data
3. **Exporting MIDI** - Correct note durations in MIDI file
4. **Exporting MusicXML** - Proper note values in score notation
5. **Exporting TXT** - Rhythm values listed in text format

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Rhythm controls don't appear for my imitation/fugue  
**Solution:** Scroll down to the visualization card - controls are below each melody

**Problem:** Changes to rhythm don't affect playback  
**Solution:** Make sure you're clicking the "Play" button on the specific composition card

**Problem:** Exported MIDI has wrong rhythm  
**Solution:** Add composition to Song Composer first, then export the complete song

**Problem:** Can't find rhythm controls for counterpoint  
**Solution:** Counterpoint rhythm is automatic (from species counterpoint algorithm)

## 💡 Tips & Tricks

1. **Create rhythmic counterpoint:** Set different rhythms for each voice in a fugue
2. **Augmentation:** Double all rhythm values for a slower voice
3. **Diminution:** Halve all rhythm values for a faster voice
4. **Syncopation:** Use eighth/sixteenth notes strategically
5. **Rhythmic independence:** Each composition maintains separate rhythm data
