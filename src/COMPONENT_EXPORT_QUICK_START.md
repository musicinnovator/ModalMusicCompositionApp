## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Use JSON for Harmony
Harmony components have chord data that only JSON preserves!
```
✅ JSON = Full chord voicings + labels + analysis
❌ MIDI = Only melody line
```

### Tip 2: Composite for DAW Work
Import all components at once into your DAW as separate tracks
```
✅ Composite = One file, multiple tracks
❌ Individual = Many files to import manually
```

### Tip 3: Individual for Sharing
Send specific parts to collaborators
```
✅ Individual = "Here's the harmony for bar 8"
❌ Composite = "Find it in this big file..."
```

### Tip 4: Always Keep JSON Backup
Full data preservation for archiving
```
✅ JSON = Can reconstruct everything
❌ MIDI/XML = Loses metadata
```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Which format should I use?**
A: 
- DAW work → MIDI
- Sheet music → MusicXML
- Backup/Archive → JSON

**Q: What's the difference between Composite and Individual?**
A:
- Composite = One file with everything
- Individual = Separate file for each component

**Q: Will MIDI preserve my harmony chords?**
A: Yes! In MIDI, chords become separate tracks that play simultaneously.

**Q: Can I re-import JSON files?**
A: Not automatically yet, but JSON contains all data needed to recreate components.

**Q: What if export fails?**
A: Check browser console for errors. Most common: no components selected.
