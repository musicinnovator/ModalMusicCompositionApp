## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Beginners
1. **Start simple**: Use Strict Canon with octave interval
2. **Keep themes short**: 8-12 notes maximum
3. **Use 2 voices**: Add more as you get comfortable
4. **Standard delay**: 4 beats is almost always good
5. **Test instruments**: Piano + Violin is a safe combo

### For Intermediate
1. **Try fifth intervals**: More interesting than octaves
2. **Experiment with delay**: 2-6 beats for different effects
3. **Use 3-4 voices**: Richer without being overwhelming
4. **Mix instruments**: Try contrasting timbres (Piano + Flute)
5. **Add to Song Suite**: Build complete compositions

### For Advanced
1. **Combine transformations**: Use multiple canon types in one piece
2. **Complex rhythms**: Try longer themes with varied rhythms
3. **Modal exploration**: Use different modes for each canon
4. **MIDI export**: Analyze in DAW for deeper understanding
5. **Historical study**: Compare with actual baroque examples

## 🎯 Common Questions

### Q: Why do some canons sound "off"?
**A:** Try these fixes:
- Reduce interval (12 or 7 usually works)
- Increase delay (4-6 beats)
- Simplify theme (fewer notes, smoother motion)
- Check mode compatibility

### Q: Which canon type should I start with?
**A:** Start with **Strict Canon** at octave (12 semitones). It's the most forgiving.

### Q: How many voices should I use?
**A:** 
- Beginners: 2 voices
- Intermediate: 3-4 voices
- Advanced: 4-6 voices

### Q: What's the difference between aliases?
**A:**
- **Per Augmentationem** = Rhythmic Canon with 2.0 ratio
- **Ad Diapente** = Strict Canon at fifth (7 semitones)
- **Mensurabilis** = Rhythmic Canon with ratios
- **Perpetuus** = Crab Canon designed to loop
- **Per Motum Contrarium** = Inversion Canon at unison

### Q: Can I use canons in the Song Creation Suite?
**A:** YES! After generating a canon:
1. Go to "Complete Song Creation Suite"
2. Switch to "Compose" tab
3. Your canon appears in "Available Components"
4. Drag it onto the timeline
